my personal .bashrc files, with all my alias, tricks and ascii art

if you want to reuse the file, remember to add the "." at the beginning of the file
(Giuthub does not allow to upload files that have a "." At the beginning of the file)

Or simply copy and paste the content of the txt file at the beginning of yor .bashrc file
(remember to make a backup first!)
